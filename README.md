## Installation

### With Package Control

See http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation for instructions.

Open the palette (Control+Shift+P or Command+Shift+P) in Sublime Text and select Package Control: Install Package and then select "YAML Nav" from the list.

### Manually

 * cd <YOUR PACKAGES DIRECTORY> (eg. ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages)
 * git clone http://github.com/ddiachkov/sublime-yaml-nav

## Key bindings

Command+R (Control+R) in YAML source will run "goto_yaml_symbol" command.

Command+Shift+W (Control+Shift+W) in YAML source will run "copy_yaml_symbol_to_clipboard" command.

## Navigation depth

By default, navigation is built to three levels deep maximum, you can control this with 'maxlevel' setting in configuration file

## Localization YAML's

Since version 1.2.0 YAML Nav tries to detect YAML's with localization data (ie. Rails locales) and automatically strips first tag when symbol is copied to the clipboard (Super+Shift+W). For example "en.active_record.attributes.entity.name" will be copied as "active_record.attributes.entity.name".

This behavior can be disabled by setting ```"trim_language_tag_on_copy_from_locales": false``` in configuration file ("YAML Nav.sublime-settings").

## Symbols

Since version 1.4.0 YAML Nav automatically trims leading colons from symbols. This behavior can be disabled by setting ```"trim_leading_colon": false``` in configuration file ("YAML Nav.sublime-settings").

## Licence

All of YAML Nav is licensed under the MIT licence.
